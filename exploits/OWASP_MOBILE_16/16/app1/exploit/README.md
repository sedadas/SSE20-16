# App0 - M5: Insufficient Cryptography
[toc]

## Build
To build the app, run either `build-windows.bat` (Windows) or `build-linux.sh` (Linux). These scripts create an Android-package in the `\app0\src\app\build\outputs\apk\debug` folder called `app-debug.apk`.

The package can be installed on any Android phone with Android 7 or higher. To install the application, the option _"Unknown source"_ in the device settings must be activated.
